                    Hi, I am Serhat Uluc. I have studied Civil Engineering in Istanbul Technical University. I have been in Slovenia as exchange
                    student. Both of the universities are the best in their country. I believe i have the good grasp of mathematic,pyhsics and
                    engineering in much sense. As far as i am aware of myself, i had always a lot of interest in various areas such as ecenmomy,
                    law, sociology, mathematic, pyshics. But lately, i have fallen in love with the programming. As i say i am a natural learner
                    and curious person. But in the world of programming i have been the highest of myself. I am sad i have met it a bit late. But
                    i am spending most of my time when i am not at work to improve myself in programming.
